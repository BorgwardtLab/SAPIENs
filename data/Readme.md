This folder contains the data that was used as test set, in order to replicate the test results from [**load_trained_model.ipynb**](https://github.com/LaetitiaPapaxanthos/SAPIENs/blob/master/code/trained_model/notebook/load_trained_model.ipynb). 
The training and validation sets used in the paper are also available.

This folder also contains the training and validation data with only 5000 sequences each in order to make sure that the model can be trained in a reasonable time if needed to run a quick test (<15 minutes).
